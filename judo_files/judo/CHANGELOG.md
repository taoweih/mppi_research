# v0.0.3

## Added
* Action normalization (@yunhaif, #54)
    * Added three types of action normalizer: `none` (default, doing nothing), `min_max` (normalizing with actuator control range), and `running` (tracking running mean and std to normalize actions)
    * Added tests for the normalizers and their integration with the controller.
    * Users can change the action normalizer under the controller tab in the GUI.

## Documentation
* Updated the README with the arxiv link for the paper (@alberthli, #56)
* Created `docs` dependency group for even easier one-command installation of docs deps for both conda and pixi (@alberthli, #57)

## Dev
* Made `pixi-version` use `latest` instead of pinned version in all workflows (@alberthli, #59)

# v0.0.2
This release contains bugfixes prior to RSS 2025.

## Added
* New `judo`-specific branding! (@slecleach, #42)

* Fixed `max_opt_iters` not correctly being applied (@lujieyang and @tzhao-bdai, #14)
    * Added a test to check for this case (@alberthli, #16)

* Fix bug where when `max_opt_iters>1`, the shape of `nominal_knots` is not correct. **NEW BEHAVIOR:** in the controller, `self.nominal_knots` now has shape `(num_knots, nu)` instead of `(1, num_knots, nu)` (@yunhaif, #29).
* Update model loading so that textures appear correctly in the visualizer (@pculbertson, #32)
* Fix bug where leap cube task encountered division by 0 in axis normalization (@alberthli, #34)
